# ChromaCommon
Common HTML/JS files for Chroma Designs

* Common animation templates are in the [animations](animations) subfolder.

* Common script is used with the [ChromaDesign_Template](https://github.com/razerofficial/ChromaDesign_Template) template samples.

* Common files are also used by the [Chroma Animation Guide](https://chroma.razer.com/ChromaGuide/).


Two useful JS libraries which both use the same API referenced in the guide and should be interchangible:

* [ChromaSDKImpl.js](ChromaSDKImpl.js) - Chroma REST API Client

* [ChromaSDKWS.js](ChromaSDKWS.js) - Chroma WebSocket Client
